This folder contains an r script, ggplot figures, converted .csv files, and the original excel files generated by Matt with new occurrence records for cheatgrass and house sparrows. For each occurrence record, we also have the estimated population growth rate for the model. We are interested in how much association there is between these measures.

The house sparrow file is too large (>100K rows), so I am converting it to .csv and then to an RDS object that will be included in the repository.
