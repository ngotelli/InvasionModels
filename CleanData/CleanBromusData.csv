# Created from original file "Bromus Lambdas and Climate Data.csv"
# Provided by Alden Griffith and Michael Loic
# Modified by NJG 17Jul2019
# --------------------------
# Notes from original file:
# Lambda values are calculated from April seedling density values (Lambda = Nt+1 / Nt)
# 'Starting Density' = Nt
# Seedling density (and thus lambda) values are averaged across microhabitats. (Not explicitly taking cover of microhabitat into account)
# All climate data are from periods between the two seedling density censuses in April
# 'Growing Season' = Apr 15 - Jun 30 (vegetative growth)
# 'Winter' = Dec 1 - Apr 14 (seedling germination and establishment)
# "DD was calculated by summing up only positive mean daily temps (i.e. base temp of 0 C). Also included is a version ('Winter DD no snowpack') that only included days when there was no snowpack, as soil temp (and seeds within) shouldn't be affected by air temp above a snowpack."
# All data are from NOHRSC station KMMH (https://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/interactive/html/graph.html?units=0&region=us&station=KMMH&ey=2019&em=7&ed=4&eh=11)
